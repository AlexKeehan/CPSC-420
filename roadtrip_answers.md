1. The distance line is smoother after the changes. There are more speed data points than before, which smooths out the distance line. As the data points increase, each one has less of an impact on the distance line, which would cause it to smooth out.
2a. The units for acceleration are mph squared
2b. Distance and speed are never negative, but acceleration is, which makes sense because that indicates slowing down.
3. Currently the limiting factor in the simulation is time. The simulation will not end when it hits a certain distance mark, but it will end when it hits 9 hours. To make sure Stephen gets to Wichita, the limiting factor should be changed to the distance, so that the simulation will only end when distance is 500.
